All SQL code run on `test` or `prod` databases should be reviewed and stored in this folder. 
Please see [../docs/db/README](../docs/db/README.md) for more information. 

# Style 

1. Document your SQL code as best as you can to help both reviewers and maintainers. 
1. Make sure your script can be re-run without causing errors or duplications if possible. 
This makes it easier to re-run locally for testing. 

# File name convention 

As a visual aid, we prefix a number to the file name as a means to indicate logical order.
